## What is Astro?

</br>

Astro is a modern web framework tailored for content-driven websites. It offers a unique approach by combining the advantages of both static site generation and server-side rendering (SSR).

</br>

## Benefits of Using Astro

</br>

**1. Blazing-Fast Static Sites:**

Astro leverages static site generation to render HTML pages on the server. This eliminates the need for JavaScript during the initial page load, resulting in lightning-fast website performance.

**2. Dynamic Content with SSR:**

Astro's "Island Architecture" allows for selective SSR for highly dynamic sections of your website. This provides the flexibility to seamlessly integrate interactive widgets without compromising the speed and efficiency of static content.

**3. Seamless Integration with Frameworks:**

Astro seamlessly integrates with popular frameworks such as React, Vue, and Svelte. This allows developers to leverage their preferred frameworks while benefiting from Astro's core features.

**4. Content-Agnostic Approach:**

Astro is agnostic to the source of backend content, making it compatible with any data source. This flexibility enables you to integrate your website with various content management systems or databases.

**5. Zero JavaScript by Default:**

Astro outputs zero JavaScript by default, minimizing the initial page load and enhancing overall performance. This approach is ideal for websites that prioritize speed and accessibility.
